    """Virtual Machine Network owned by a Provider.

    A VM Network is uniquely identified in the Provider by its uuid.
    It has a name and a set of parameters such as the MTU.
    A Network can be public (shared) or private.
    If it is public it has no relationships, otherwise it is connected
    only to the Project who has access.
    When a Project has multiple private or public networks, it is mandatory
    to specify which is the default one.
    For VM using private networks, to access to the VM, users need to use a Proxy.
    To use the Proxy they require the proxy IP and the username to use to access.
